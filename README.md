-----------------------------------

Welcome to POE-TradeMacro!

**PoE TradeMacro** is an Autohotkey (AHK) script that provides several convenient QoL features for Path of Exile Trading.

This builds on top of [PoE-ItemInfo](https://github.com/aRTy42/POE-ItemInfo) which provides very useful item information on **ctrl+c**.
With TradeMacro, price checking is added via **alt+d**, **alt+shift+d** or **alt+i**. You can also open the items wiki page via **alt+w** or open the item search on poe.trade instead via **alt+q**. (Before TradeMacro version 2.15.3 `ctrl` was used instead of `alt` as defaults).  
TradeMacro will be updated to always have the latest PoE-ItemInfo code, you don't have to run their script since it's included here.


#### Warning ####

Never completely trust any price checking tool. Inform yourself about what this tool can do and what not (FAQ for example). Use the tools average and median prices to quickly judge if the first results could be accurate or totally wrong. When in doubt ask other people or do some manual checks.

#### Usage / Instructions ####

1. Install AHK (http://ahkscript.org). Don't install AutoHotkey v2.x. PSA: If AHK crashes when starting TradeMacro try and use a different version, `AutoHotkey_1.1.26.01` should always work.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/POE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro/releases/latest) and extract the zip-file. 
3. Make sure to run PoE in (borderless) windowed mode. Otherwise it won't work!
4. Run **_Run_TradeMacro.ahk_**.
5. Default league is set to `tmpstandard` (Softcore Temp-League).
6. A lot of options, including the league can be changed by opening the settings window or editing `config_trade.ini`.
7. Make sure to play Path of Exile in english, if you're using a different language it probably won't work.

> **Right-click the script icon in your system tray and select `PoE Item Info Settings` to open the settings window and to edit both `PoE-ItemInfos` and `PoE-TradeMacros` settings.**

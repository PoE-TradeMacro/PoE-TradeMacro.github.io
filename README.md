# Welcome to POE-TradeMacro!

**PoE TradeMacro** is an Autohotkey (AHK) script that provides several convenient QoL features for Path of Exile Trading. This includes automatic price check macro.

####Usage / Instructions####

1. Install AHK (http://ahkscript.org)
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/POE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro/releases/latest) and extract the zip-file. 
3. Make sure to run PoE in (borderless) windowed mode. Otherwise it won't work!
4. Run **_Run_Only_This.ahk_**.
5. Default league is set to SC Temp, you can change this by right-clicking on the system tray icon > PoE (Trade) Item Info Settings.
6. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro/wiki) for faqs and details about the different settings.

####Shortcuts####

|Shortcut|Description|
|---	|---	|
| ctrl+d      | Price item on poe.trade.
| ctrl+alt+d  | Advanced item search for `uniques`. 
| ctrl+c      | See item info (via PoE-ItemInfo).

## Additional Notes

PoE-TradeMacro builds on top of [PoE-ItemInfo](https://github.com/aRTy42/POE-ItemInfo) (cheers to the ItemInfo team) which provides very useful item information on **ctrl+c**. TradeMacro will be updated to always have the latest PoE-ItemInfo code, you don't have to run their script since it's included here.
